/**
 * A {@link PolicyInformationPoint} (PIP) gathers information from the current execution environment and populates the
 * subject, environment, and resource information within a {@link Request}.
 * 
 * It is possible that a PIP is not applicable in all cases. For example an application that accepts both X.509
 * certificates and Kerberos ticket as authentication methods might have one PIP for dealing with the certificates and
 * another for dealing with the ticket. Therefore a PIP should indicate that it does not apply to a current request by
 * returning <code>false</code> from the {@link #populateRequest(Request)} method. It should <strong>not</strong> throw
 * an exception in this case.
 * 
 * Some example of what a policy information point may do would be:
 * <ul>
 * <li>evaluate a user's authentication credential in order to populate subject information</li>
 * <li>interrogate the operating system to provide information about the current environment</li>
 * <li>call out to other portions of the application in order to determine the identity of the application and populate
 * resource information</li>
 * </ul>
